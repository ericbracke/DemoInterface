Qlik Sense web landing page to impersonate Qlik user personas

I'm calling this project the "Qlik Demo Interface". Qlik is such a versatile platform that demonstrating it's true potential is not easy to do. I've created this project to illustrate what an "enterprise deployment" might look like and you can actually impersonate different users and their role in an organization. This page is dedicated to the demo interface project and resources required for all of you to get it, use it, and close business!
